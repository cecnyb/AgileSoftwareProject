**Description**

This project aims to create the foundation of a website which will work as a platform for people trying to get a water scoter license. The main functionality for the website is to display the chapters and subchapters of the theory needed to get the license. The website also differentiates between different kinds of users; students, moderators and supermoderators. **The intention is for moderators to be able to overview all their students' progress, although this has not been implemented yet.**
