Titles and internal titles
A title should explain clearly what we have here, and it's usually a project's name - a H1 heading prefaced with #. 
If a project's name doesn't disclose its content, still it's worth to suggest what it is.


# agile_software ? 

## Introduction - the project's aim
The code is written in javaScript in a React-project. There is also a database in firestore which keeps track of all users and which type of user it is. 

This project aims to create the foundaments of a website which will work as a platform for people trying to get a 
water scoter license. The main functionality for the website is to display the chapters and subchapters of the theory needed
to get the license. The website also differentiates between different kinds of users; students, moderators and supermoderators. 
The intention is for moderators to be able to overview all their students' progress, although this has not been implemented yet.
